# **“Prediflex” Smart Insole for pediatric orthopedic monitoring**

Virtual design and analytical modeling of an energy-harvesting microcontroller system powered by passive piezoelectric sensors that convert biomechanical energy into usable electrical power. The harvested energy supports both the microcontroller and wireless communication modules, all conforming to relevant international standards. The system architecture emphasizes ultra-low-power operation, the use of sustainable materials, and seamless integration to enable real-time pediatric gait analysis with predictive assessment of potential abnormalities.
